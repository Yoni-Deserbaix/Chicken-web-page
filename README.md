# Project Chicken Cuisine üçó

This project was created with the aim of discovering the React framework and exploring the creation of web components. It's a simple web page displaying a list of chicken-based dishes. The primary goal was to familiarize myself with React, learn how to design reusable components, and deploy them.

## Project Objectives

- Discovering and learning React and component creation.
- Developing a web page showcasing a list of chicken dishes.
- Visual design for an appealing presentation of the components.
- Using this project as a code and component example for future projects.

## Deployment and Utility 

This project was deployed to demonstrate my skills in visual design and React component development. While it doesn't currently contain advanced features, it serves as a useful example of reusable components. The intention is to expand it in the future to add functionality and evolve it into a more comprehensive project.
